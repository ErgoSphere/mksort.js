# mksort.js

mksort.js is standalone JavaScript module providing SQL "ORDER BY" ASC/DESC sorting
on multiple keys of arrays of objects.

Sorting arrays of uneven objects will be unpredictable if you use any keys missing 
from some objects.

This module was developed specifically to sort .rows arrays of csvjson.js csv2json 
output objects.

demo.html shows a sample use case.
